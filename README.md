# carsharing
University project made in C for the "Computer Laboratory" course during the 1st year of my BSc in Computer Science at the University of Bari Aldo Moro.

// !!! Disclaimer !!!
This was my first project in C, so there may be mistakes, and perhaps the code could be better optimized. The projecting and implementation were directly handled by Angelo Polito, while the project's outline was conceived by the teacher. The implementation correctly meets the specified requirements.

// Description of the project: 
Creation of a Carsharing platform which allows to drivers to load travels and customers to reserve travels. It is also possible to view drivers' ratings (insert by customers).

// Technical specifications
Code is realized in C and it is divided into 4 sections:
  - main.c
  - gestione_guidatori.c (header file: gestione_guidatori.h)
  - gestione_viaggi.c (header file: gestione_viaggi.h)
  - visualizza_menu.c (header file: visualizza_menu.h)
Header files:
  - gestione_guidatori.h
  - gestione_viaggi.h
  - visualizza_menu.h
  - strutture.h
There are also two .bin files to permanently store data:
